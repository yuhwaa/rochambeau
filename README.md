Rochambeau allows you to play a simple rock, paper and scissors game with your computer. Enter either rock paper or scissors in the input field and click the button to submit your choice, and the computer's choice plus the result will appear. If you enter an invalid value, an instruction message will show up.

You will need to install Node.js on your machine to be able to run the server.js and make the rest work. Another thing you will need to install is figlet, and you can do it by entering 'npm i figlet' on your terminal, but the game should run just fine without installing figlet. Type "node server.js" in your terminal and go to localhost: 8000 on your browser to access the page.

This game is written based on the node-backend-simple-json files created by Leon Noel (https://leonnoel.com/) from his #100Devs cohort.
